Q3. How have the trends for electric cars sales and electric trucks sales developed for the current top four leading countries?

The plot illustrates a significant increase in car ownership in the top four leading countries over the past decade. 
This trend is particularly pronounced in China, where car ownership has surged dramatically since 2020. Itâ€™s noteworthy that in all four countries, the rise in car ownership began around 2020. 
This simultaneous increase suggests a common factor or set of factors influencing car ownership trends globally during this period.
