    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, there has been significant attention on climate change and the emissions generated by cars and trucks worldwide. \n",
    "This growing awareness has led to a pressing need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which can be achieved through the adoption of electric vehicles. \n",
    "As a result, an increasing number of electric cars and trucks can be observed on the roads.\n",
    "\n",
    "To investigate this trend, this research examines how the sales of electric cars and trucks have developed between 2010 and 2022. \n",
    "By analysing sales data over this period, insights can be gained into the increasing impact of electric vehicles worldwide.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent absolute sales figures from giving a distorted view of each country’s true impact, the data for electric cars and trucks is normalised according to three different factors. \n",
    "All three factors highlight different aspects of a country’s data. The first factor accounts for demographic differences, based on the population of each country. \n",
    "The second normalisation is based on an economic factor, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The final normalisation is based on a welfare indicator, the Human Development Index (HDI). This normalization approach provides a more nuanced perspective on differences in electric vehicle sales across countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the data sets for electric cars and trucks and the normalisation data sets in Python, the research question and its sub-questions can be answered.\n"

    "Development of total Electric Car Sales\n",
    "\n",
    "Research has shown a significant increase of electric vehicles (EVs) sales each year from 2010 to 2022 in the World. \n",
    "A distinction can be made between battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). \n",
    "Regarding electric car sales, a shift in the two categories occurs in 2014. \n",
    "Since then, both lines have experienced increases, but the slope of the BEV line is significantly steeper than that of the PHEV line, indicating a more pronounced growth. \n",
    "Despite this difference, both categories show a similar pattern of fluctuation over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Devlopment of total Electric Truck Sales\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the yearly sales of battery electric vehicles (BEVs), the figures from 2010 to 2014 are nearly negligible, with a significant increase starting in 2014.\n",
    "This surge peaks in 2017, after which sales decline to a low point in 2020.\n",
    "However, from this moment onward, sales begin to rise again.\n",
    "The sales figures for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) only begin in 2015, and the number of PHEVs sold remains minimal compared to BEVs.\n",
    "This discrepancy can be partly explained by the limited availability of data on PHEVs, as comprehensive data is only accessible for a few countries.\n",
    "Consequently, the yearly total represented in the graph does not allow for meaningful conclusions about PHEV sales trends.\n",
    "Due to the sparse data, it is challenging to make robust analyses or draw significant conclusions regarding the performance of PHEVs in the market.\n",
    "The lack of comprehensive data hinders our ability to compare PHEV sales effectively with BEVs or to assess the overall growth and market acceptance of PHEVs over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that data availability varies by year and country. Consequently, the dataset and results are not fully comprehensive."

    "*Which four countries are the global leaders in electric car and truck sales, and how have these sales developed from 2010 to 2022?*\n",
    "\n",
    "This sub-research question is used to evaluate how global sales of electric cars and trucks (both fully battery electric and plug-in hybrid) have progressed between 2010 and 2022 by country. To answer this sub-research question, three different bar graphs for both electric cars and electric trucks are established. By means of a slider the progression of sales per year is shown. \n",
    "\n",
    "For electric cars more data is available than for electric trucks, which explains the difference in detail and extensiveness between the evaluation of these two. For some countries there is no data available from 2010 onwards, for these countries the number of EVs sold remains at zero until data is available.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The first graph shows the annual sales of electric cars by country. All countries for which data is available are shown in a bar graph, where the y-axis represents the countries and the x-axis represents the number of electric cars sold per year. The chart includes a slider to display sales figures by year.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, electric car sales increase annually, although there are years when this is not the case. An example is the Netherlands, where 23,000 electric cars were sold in 2013 and the number dropped to 15,000 in 2014. Although the top four countries with the highest sales vary each year, overall the United States, China, Japan, Norway, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands perform consistently well.\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar bar graph was prepared for electric truck sales. Significantly less data is available for this sector, which limits the representativeness of the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the second graph, the dataset was expanded to include a column that calculates each country's share of annual sales. This takes the total sales per year as 100%. Then the number of cars sold per country is divided by total sales for that year and multiplied by 100 to calculate the percentage. The graph, similar to the first graph, is a bar graph with a slider, but now shows the sales percentages by country. \n",
    "\n",
    "The final graph shows the cumulative sales of electric cars by country through 2022. Whereas the earlier graphs provided insight into annual sales, this graph provides an overview of total sales by country over the period 2010-2022. Countries that started EV adoption relatively early and continue to invest in it consistently will show higher cumulative values. It provides insight into which countries are continuously investing in electric vehicles and how much that commitment will pay off in the long run. To calculate this cumulative data, an additional column has been added to the dataset in which yearly sales are added to previous years' sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph is again a bar graph with a slider. Based on this final graph, it can be concluded that the top four countries with the most electric cars sold between 2010 and 2022 are: \n",
    "1. China (14,000,000 sales)\n",
    "2. The United States (3,400,000 sales)\n",
    "3. Germany (2,200,000 sales) \n",
    "4. The United Kingdom (1,100,000 sales). \n",

    "It’s noteworthy that in all four countries of the top four of 2022 (China, USA, Germany and United Kingdom), a rise in EV sales began around 2020.\n",
    "This simultaneous increase suggests that there may be common factors or influences driving global EV sales trends during this period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trucks\n",
    "\n",
    "In the top four leading truck-sales countries in 2022, China is again leading.\n",
    "It is interesting to see that the number of trucks sold is very different from cars.\n",
    "It is also remarkable that the sale of electric trucks in China peaked in 2017.\n",
    "After this peak, the sale of electric trucks in China decreased until 2020.\n",
    "From this point on, sales have started to grow again, reaching higher levels of trucks sold per year.\n",
    "For the other countries in the top four—Germany, Brazil, and Canada— it can be concluded that the sales in these countries do not differ much from each other.\n",
    "Not all data is available for these countries.\n",
    "For example, Germany started collecting data in 2018, while China started in 2015 and Canada in 2010.\n",
    "This makes it very hard to compare data and derive conclusions for the first half of the timeframe.\n",
    "After all, it can be concluded that China is the biggest player in truck sales per year."

To obtain this data, a new dataframe that contains the value of the amount of inhabitants per country is added to the python file. Using this new dataframe, a new column is created in the original dataframe that calculates the value of the sales, divided by the value for the inhabitants for each year per country. This new value is then plotted in a bar graph, using a slider that shows the data per year. This way, the development of the electric vehicle sales per inhabitant is shown through the years. The bar plot is, just like in the questions above, shown in descending order.

Iceland has a relative small population of only 387,559 inhabitants, so compared to a country like China it is obvious they do not have the same absolute electric vehicle car sales.

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "From 2010 to 2022, electric vehicle sales have grown a lot, especially for battery electric vehicles (BEVs), which make up a large share of these sales. \n",
    "Electric truck sales are also increasing, but their growth has been less steady than that of electric cars. \n",
    "Overall, the number of electric cars sold worldwide is still much higher than the number of electric trucks, showing a big gap in demand between the two.\n",
    "The number of electric vehicles sold has varied a lot by country over recent years. \n",
    "Each year, car sales in the top four leading countries of 2022 have generally gone up, with China having by far the highest electric car sales overall.\n",
    "For electric trucks, though, China stands out as the biggest player, but its sales numbers have changed quite a bit from year to year, while ohter countries have a very little growth. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When normalizing electric vehicle sales by population, Norway and Sweden are the only countries that ranked in the top four in 2022 for both electric car and electric truck sales. \n",
    "Overall, the number of electric car and truck sales has been rising for every country included in the data, especially since 2019, except for China, which saw a significant drop starting in 2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "When normalizing electric vehicle sales based on GDP, Norway and Sweden are still in the top four for both electric car and truck sales. \n",
    "For electric cars, the countries show similar growth compared to normalizing per inhabitant, with sales rising each year and speeding up since 2019. \n",
    "For electric trucks based on GDP, China is still a major player but saw also in this case a big drop in sales after 2017. \n",
    "The other countries follow similar patterns as when we look at sales by population, with only small differences in rankings and growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "When normalizing electric vehicle sales by the Human Development Index (HDI), the top four countries in electric car sales have shown steady growth since data collection began in 2010. China stands out, leading in sales and making significant progress, especially since 2020.\n",
    "For electric truck sales, the pattern is similar to previous analyses: China’s sales have dropped, while sales in other countries have stayed mostly flat with only small increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, electric vehicle sales have increased between 2010 and 2022. For electric car sales, normalizing based on population and GDP shows similar results. However, normalizing based on HDI reveals new patterns and different rankings among the countries.\n",
    "The analysis of electric truck sales is consistent across all the normalization methods used, with China remaining the largest player each year."

    "# Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis in this report highlights electric vehicle (EV) sales across various countries and shows the results of normalizing these data by inhabitants, GDP and HDI. However, it’s important to note that these normalization methods are only a few of the many ways data can be adjusted to compare countries with different characteristics. The choice of normalization depends largely on the aspect one wants to emphasize. Other normalizations, such as adjusting for factors like average income or road infrastructure could reveal additional insights and may shift the rankings or highlight different trends in EV sales across countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, this report faces a significant limitation in the truck analysis due to the availability of data on electric trucks, which is considerably scarcer than data on electric cars. Only a limited number of countries provide data on electric truck sales and the data that is available often lacks the same historical depth found in car sales data. This disparity could influence the trends observed, particularly in the normalization results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another key consideration is that this analysis focuses solely on sales data. Sales figures give an indication of market growth and consumer interest but do not necessarily translate into the number of EVs actively on the road or their actual impact on transportation networks. Sales alone do not account for the lifespan of the vehicles, rates of usage, or how widely they are adopted in daily operations, particularly for electric trucks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, external factors such as government incentives, infrastructure development and energy policy play a crucial role in EV adoption but are not accounted for in this analysis. For instance, countries with strong government support for EV infrastructure or financial incentives may see higher sales, irrespective of their inhabitants, GDP or HDI. Considering these policy influences alongside the normalization factors could yield a more comprehensive understanding of what drives EV adoption in different regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, while normalizing data can help account for structural differences between countries, the effectiveness of these methods depends on the research goals. Further research using alternative normalization factors and more granular data, especially for electric trucks, could enhance the understanding of global EV adoption trends and their implications."
