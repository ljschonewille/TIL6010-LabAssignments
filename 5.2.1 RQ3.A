SQ3: Which four countries are leading in electric car and truck sales per inhabitant, and how have these sales developed? (normalized to demographics)
Q3.A: Which four counties are leading in electric car and truck sales per inhabitant?

DEMOGRAPHIC
Algemeen:
In the previous questions, the countries that are leading in fully electric sales and plug-in hybrid sales of electric cars and electric trucks are given. In subquestion 3 we explore this development of
sales per country based on a demographic factor: inhabitants. The data in this sub question will not only show the growth per country in absolute sales, but also the development of these sales per inhabitant.
In these graphs, the electric vehicle sales per inhabitant are given for each country. To obtain this data, a new dataframe that contains the value of the amount of inhabitants per country is added to the
python file. Using this new dataframe, a new column is created in the original dataframe that calculates the value of the sales, divided by the value for the inhabitants for each year per country. This new
value is then plotted in a bar graph, using a slider that shows the data per year. This way, the development of the electric vehicle sales per inhabitant is shown through the years. The bar plot is, just like
in the questions above, shown in descending order. The country that has the highest electric car or truck sales is shown on the top and the corresponding value is given as well. The value that is shown is
small, as this is the value of the car or truck sales per inhabitant.

Normalised graph per inhabitant for cars and trucks:
In the first graph, the electric car and truck sales are shown per inhabitant for each country. For example for the year 2022 in the electric car sales graph, Iceland scores as the top country for electric car sales,
whereas in the absolute sales Iceland is in the bottom half. Iceland has a relative small population of only 387,559 inhabitants, so compared to a country like China it is obvious they do not have the same absolute
electric vehicle car sales. This graph shows the sales as a value per inhabitant and therefore it is a more accurate representation of the development of electric car sales for the size of the country.

The same valuations are done for the sales of electric trucks. In this first graph, the electric truck sales per inhabitant are shown in a bar plot for each country, using a slider for each year. In this case
for 2022, Norway is the top country per inhabitant, in comparison to China, which was the top country for absolute truck sales. The values shown for the trucks are very small. The value for the top country Norway
in 2022 is only 97Î¼; this shows the number of sold electric trucks is very small compared to the size of the countries.

The bar graphs below show the percentagse of car and truck sales per inhabitant per country, which are done in the same way as in subquestion 2. They give a more clear overview of the share of each country in the
electric car and truck sales according to their demographic size (inhabitants).

[tekst voor boven sum grafiekjes]
This final car and truck graph show the sum of the electric car and truck sales per inhabitant for each country, summing up the value of sold electric cars per inhabitant from 2010 to 2022. Here we can see that the
top country for the electric car sales is not Iceland, but Norway. In total Norway has sold more cars per inhabitant than Iceland.

The electric truck graph shows the sum of the electric truck sales per inhabitant per country, summing from 2010 to 2022. In this graph, Norway has the highest total sum of sold electric trucks in 2022. This shows that 
they are the leading country in overall electric truck sales.
