Conclusion

The research question that was posed at the beginning of this report is the following: *How have sales of electric cars and electric trucks developed in the world between 2010 and 2022?* To answer this research 
question, five different sub questions were explored using several databases. 


From 2010 to 2022, electric vehicle sales have grown a lot, especially for battery electric vehicles (BEVs), which make up a large share of these sales. 
Electric truck sales are also increasing, but their growth has been less steady than that of electric cars. 
Overall, the number of electric cars sold worldwide is still much higher than the number of electric trucks, showing a big gap in demand between the two.
