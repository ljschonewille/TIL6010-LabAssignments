Conclusion

The research question that was posed at the beginning of this report is the following: *How have sales of electric cars and electric trucks developed in the world between 2010 and 2022?* To answer this research 
question, five different sub questions were explored using several databases. 


From 2010 to 2022, electric vehicle sales have grown a lot, especially for battery electric vehicles (BEVs), which make up a large share of these sales. 
Electric truck sales are also increasing, but their growth has been less steady than that of electric cars. 
Overall, the number of electric cars sold worldwide is still much higher than the number of electric trucks, showing a big gap in demand between the two.
The number of electric vehicles sold has varied a lot by country over recent years. 
Each year, car sales in the top four leading countries of 2022 have generally gone up, with China having by far the highest electric car sales overall.
For electric trucks, though, China stands out as the biggest player, but its sales numbers have changed quite a bit from year to year, while ohter countries have a very little growth. 


When normalizing electric vehicle sales by population, Norway and Sweden are the only countries that ranked in the top four in 2022 for both electric car and electric truck sales. 
Overall, the number of electric car and truck sales has been rising for every country included in the data, especially since 2019, except for China, which saw a significant drop starting in 2017.

When normalizing electric vehicle sales based on GDP, Norway and Sweden are still in the top four for both electric car and truck sales. 
For electric cars, the countries show similar growth compared to normalizing per inhabitant, with sales rising each year and speeding up since 2019. 
For electric trucks based on GDP, China is still a major player but saw also in this case a big drop in sales after 2017. 
The other countries follow similar patterns as when we look at sales by population, with only small differences in rankings and growth.

When normalizing electric vehicle sales by the Human Development Index (HDI), the top four countries in electric car sales have shown steady growth since data collection began in 2010. China stands out, leading in sales and making significant progress, especially since 2020.
For electric truck sales, the pattern is similar to previous analyses: Chinaâ€™s sales have dropped, while sales in other countries have stayed mostly flat with only small increases.

Overall, electric vehicle sales have increased between 2010 and 2022. For electric car sales, normalizing based on population and GDP shows similar results. However, normalizing based on HDI reveals new patterns and different rankings among the countries.
The analysis of electric truck sales is consistent across all the normalization methods used, with China remaining the largest player each year.
