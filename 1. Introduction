1. Introduction

In recent years, there has been significant attention on climate change and the emissions generated by cars and trucks contribute to this problem. 
This growing awareness has led to a pressing need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which can be achieved through the adoption of electric vehicles (Wang et al. 1990. 
As a result, an increasing number of electric cars and trucks can be observed on the roads.

To investigate this trend, this research examines how the sales of electric cars and trucks have developed between 2010 and 2022. 
By analysing sales data over this period, insights can be gained into the increasing impact of electric vehicles worldwide.

To prevent absolute sales figures from giving a distorted view of each country’s true impact, the data for electric cars and trucks is normalised according to three different factors. 
All three factors highlight different aspects of a country’s data. The first factor accounts for demographic differences, based on the population of each country. 
The second normalisation is based on an economic factor, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The final normalisation is based on a welfare indicator, the Human Development Index (HDI).

Using the data sets for electric cars and trucks and the normalisation data sets in Python, the research question and its sub-questions can be answered.
