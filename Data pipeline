Data pipeline

In this section a description is given on how the data that is used is derived from an online dataset. For this, all three sets that are described in section 'Data Used' are given. The pipeline for each dataset
is given through first describing the source of the data. Then we will describe how it is processed in the python file to create a dataframe that can be used to generate the data for each sub question. Lastly, a
short description on how the data can be interpreted for each sub questions is given.

**Data pipeline 1**
*Source description*
Source: IEA50 Global EV Data Explorer - https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-tools/global-ev-data-explorer
Data collection date: 07-10-2024
Data description: from this source we downloaded a csv-file for cars. This csv-file contains EV sales share, EV stock share, EV stock and EV sales for each year and each country. The csv-file also contains all of these
parameters for EV, BEV, PHEV and FCEV.

*Data processing*
To be able to change the csv-file to an usable dataframe, we have to perform several actions:
- create a dataframe that uses only the columns that match the parameter 'EV sales'
- drop all 'FCEV' values from this new dataframe (these are not included in the EV-set)
- group the dataframe by region and year the sum all the values for different electriv vehicles (EV, BEV and PHEV) and add this to the dataframe
- drop the regions 'EU27', 'Europe', 'Rest of the World' and 'World'
- create a 0-value for every country that has no existing data for any years between 2010 and 2023

*Data interpretation*
Using the created dataframe, all sub questions about electric car sales can be answered by altering the existing dataframe for that specific sub question.


**Data pipeline 2**
*Source description*
Source: IEA50 Global EV Data Explorer - https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-tools/global-ev-data-explorer
Data collection date: 07-10-2024
Data description: from this source we downloaded a csv-file for trucks. This csv-file contains EV sales share, EV stock share, EV stock and EV sales for each year and each country. The csv-file also contains all of these
parameters for EV, BEV, PHEV and FCEV.

*Data processing*
To be able to change the csv-file to an usable dataframe, we have to perform several actions:
- create a dataframe that uses only the columns that match the parameter 'EV sales'
- drop all 'FCEV' values from this new dataframe (these are not included in the EV-set)
- group the dataframe by region and year the sum all the values for different electriv vehicles (EV, BEV and PHEV) and add this to the dataframe
- drop the regions 'EU27', 'Europe', 'Rest of the World' and 'World'
- create a 0-value for every country that has no existing data for any years between 2010 and 2023

*Data interpretation*
Using the created dataframe, all sub questions about electric truck sales can be answered by altering the existing dataframe for that specific sub question.


**Data pipeline 3**
*Source description*
Source: Our World in Data: Population Growth - https://ourworldindata.org/population-growth
Data collection date: 09-10-2024
Data description: from this source we downloaded a csv-file. This csv-file contains the data for the inhabitants for all countries in the world from 1950 to 2023.

*Data processing*
To be able to change the csv-file to an usable dataframe, we have to perform several actions:
- drop all values below 2010
- replace 'United states' by 'USA', 'Czechia' by 'Czech Republic', 'South Korea' by 'Korea' and 'Turkey' by 'Turkiye' to match the other dataframe

*Data interpretation*
Using the created dataframe, all sub questions about electric car and truck sales per inhabitant can be answered by altering the existing dataframe for that specific sub question.


**Data pipeline 4**
*Source description*
Source: Our World in Data: Population Growth - https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/national-gdp-constant-usd-wb
Data collection date: 16-10-2024
Data description: from this source we downloaded a csv-file. This csv-file contains the GDP in US dollars for all countries in the world. The earliest year GDP is added to the file is 1960. All countries have GDP-values until 2022.

*Data processing*
To be able to change the csv-file to an usable dataframe, we have to perform several actions:
- drop all values below 2010
- replace 'United states' by 'USA', 'Czechia' by 'Czech Republic', 'South Korea' by 'Korea' and 'Turkey' by 'Turkiye' to match the other dataframe

*Data interpretation*
Using the created dataframe, all sub questions about electric car and truck sales per GDP can be answered by altering the existing dataframe for that specific sub question.


**Data pipeline 5**
*Source description*
Source: Our World in Data: Population Growth - https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/human-development-index?time=latest
Data collection date: 16-10-2024
Data description: from this source we downloaded a csv-file. This csv-file contains the data for the human index for all countries in the world from 1990 to 2022.

*Data processing*
To be able to change the csv-file to an usable dataframe, we have to perform several actions:
- drop all values below 2010
- replace 'United states' by 'USA', 'Czechia' by 'Czech Republic', 'South Korea' by 'Korea' and 'Turkey' by 'Turkiye' to match the other dataframe

*Data interpretation*
Using the created dataframe, all sub questions about electric car and truck sales per human index can be answered by altering the existing dataframe for that specific sub question.
