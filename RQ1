Development of total Electric Car Sales
Research has shown a significant increase of electric vehicles (EVs) from 2010 to 2023 in the World. 
A distinction can be made between battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). 
In the realm of electric passenger transport, the sales trajectories of these two categories diverged in 2014. 
Since then, both lines have experienced increases, but the slope of the BEV line is significantly steeper than that of the PHEV line, indicating a more pronounced growth. 
Despite this difference, both categories show a similar pattern of fluctuation over time.

Devlopment of total Electric Truck Sales
Regarding the sales of battery electric vehicles (BEVs), the figures from 2010 to 2015 are nearly negligible, with a significant increase starting in 2014.
This surge peaks in 2017, after which sales decline to a low point in 2020.
However, from this moment onward, sales begin to rise again.
The sales figures for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) only begin in 2015, and the number of PHEVs sold remains minimal compared to BEVs.
This discrepancy can be partly explained by the limited availability of data on PHEVs, as comprehensive data is only accessible for a few countries.
Consequently, the cumulative total represented in the graph does not allow for meaningful conclusions about PHEV sales trends.
Due to the sparse data, it is challenging to make robust analyses or draw significant conclusions regarding the performance of PHEVs in the market.
The lack of comprehensive data hinders our ability to compare PHEV sales effectively with BEVs or to assess the overall growth and market acceptance of PHEVs over time.

It should be noted that data availability varies by year and country. Consequently, the dataset and results are not fully comprehensive.
