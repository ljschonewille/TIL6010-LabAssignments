SQ5: Which four countries are leading in electric car and truck sales per Human Development Index (HDI), and how have these sales developed? (normalized to social / welfare)
Q5.A: Which four counties are leading in electric car and truck sales per  human development index?
SOCIAL/WELFARE
To account for differences in development status between countries, electric car and truck sales per country are also normalized using the Human Development Index (HDI). According to the United Nations Development Programme, the HDI is “a summary measure of average achievement in key dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, being knowledgeable, and having a decent standard of living. The HDI is the geometric mean of normalized indices for each of the three dimensions” (United Nations, n.d.)*. Similar to the above normalizations, the HDI data is imported into the Python file and added as an additional column. The same consistent style, using bar graphs and sliders to navigate through the years, is applied.

The first graph shows sales of electric cars and trucks normalized against the Human Development Index (HDI) for each country. The HDI is an index between 0 and 1, with a lower value indicating a lower development status. Because the sales are divided by the HDI, countries with a lower HDI will have a higher normalized value. A higher normalized value indicates that, given its development level, the country is performing notably well in terms of EV adoption.
As can be seen in the graph, the normalized value of China, for example, increases considerably relative to its absolute value, suggesting that China is performing relatively well in EV adoption despite a lower HDI. Countries with little difference after normalization, such as Norway, have their EV adoption in line with their high HDI.
